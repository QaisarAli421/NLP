The NLP App is a Python-based Natural Language Processing application with a simple and user-friendly Tkinter GUI.

It allows users to analyze any text input and perform multiple NLP tasks including:

📝 Sentiment Analysis — Detect whether the text is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

🧍 Named Entity Recognition (NER) — Identify and categorize entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.

❤️ Emotion Detection — Recognize emotional tone in the text (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise).

🧹 Text Preprocessing — Clean and normalize text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and extra spaces.
